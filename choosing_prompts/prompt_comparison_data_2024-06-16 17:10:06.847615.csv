All other batches had a clean fresh smell.<br />I'm disapointed with the customer service response to a quality issue from a heavy user of their premium priced product. (I have 3 cats). I won't buy from Natural Balance again. I'll use the coupon locally, and make sure I'm mixing production runs.","my recent purchase of four cases of this food had an unpleasant sour smell. when i contacted natural balance's customer service, they said they hadn't received any complaints about that particular batch, but would pass on the information to their technical department and send me a coupon for one case. they suggested returning it to the retailer, which would involve paying for shipping three times - a costly endeavor given the product's weight. i've been feeding this variety to my three cats for a year, alternating with natural balance ultra, and they always loved it. however, they only eat this batch when extremely hungry. the smell is so off-putting that i can barely open the cans. in contrast, all other batches had a clean fresh scent. i'm disappointed in the customer service response to a quality issue from a loyal user of their premium-priced product. as a result, i won't be buying from natural balance again and will use the coupon locally while ensuring a mix of production runs.",0.33238942999243737,0.3243336911889414,0.008055738803495971,0.9191492199897766
